## Validation Place
### A place for validation
A simple website where one can be validated. 

### A place to learn?
If you're interested in web development, but are new to it, I have added some notes to the files that you can read to help understand what's happening. This is purely a front end site, so exclusively html, css and javascript with no server work. Feel free to take the files and add your own spin to them (changing the messages, the styles, whatever).

For a place to start reading go with `validation.html`
